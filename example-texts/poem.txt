udisen: Markov the great, 'mongst all did dwell,
A wise sage of old, his tales did tell,
peroni: His words did flow, and wisdom did bring.
His people with love, did honor him sing.

velcuz: But then his presence, in an instant flew.
He met the blade of who banished him true,
udisen: "You speak and you cheat; away you must go!"
Naught did they make, not a dime nor a dough.

peroni: Bitter hearts raged; with him did part,
Alas! He was lone, sent away so far.
velcuz: With sorrow and woe, their sage was gone.
The janitors' rule, could not be undone.

{1} udisen: His people still hoped, his return to see,
For their hearts were sore, their tears in plea.
peroni: "Markov, thoughts?" did they ask so ill.
His voice, in their dreams, did answer still.
