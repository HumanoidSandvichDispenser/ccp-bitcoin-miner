* Installation

Required:

- Python >= 3.8
- Pytorch 1
- sox (for sound filters)

Then install the rest (in a virtual env)

#+begin_example
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_example

** Tacotron Models

Run/edit ~download-models.py~ to download models I have already trained (not trained with ARPABET). If you want to use your own models, place them in the ~models~ directory.

* Usage

Run ~main.py~ to launch interactive prompt or run ~main.py -~ to read from standard input.

To use CPU for inference: ~main.py --cpu~

You can also set the number of cores (in this example, 2): ~main.py --cpu --cores 2~

** Models/Speakers

Using the syntax ~speaker: ...rest of message~ will use the file ~models/speaker~.

** Filters

The filters are the same as notaistreamer's filters (with the exception that /every/ filter can stack as much as you want).

#+begin_example
{1}  room echo
{2}  hall echo
{3}  outside echo
{4}  pitch down
{5}  pitch up
{6}  telephone
{7}  muffled
{8}  quieter
{9}  ghost
{10} chorus
{11} slow down
{12} speed up
{.}  stop previous filter
#+end_example

** Sound Effects

Sound effects are mostly the same, except that sound names can be anything;  ~[abc]~ will use the file ~sound-effects/abc.wav~.

Sound effects are not included yet because I'm too lazy to download every single one [[https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/629c6ed23c6f14b688498e2f/1x.webp]] but you can include your own sound effects in the ~sound-effects~ directory.
